This mod adds one more aspect of realism into [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) game: stepping onto plant damages it.

Walking over cell with plant will cause damage to plant, proportional to stepping creature size. Damage does not happen when character goes to do some agriculture job (or returns from it).

To balance this damaging, plants now slowly heal up over time, by cost of slowing down growth.

With this mod, you will feel more annoyed by pets/animals/guests destroying your crops, you'll have to plan your crops to not be on the common pathways.
